Chapter 01 - The Interview

Hey. My name is Osyra. This is my video application.

(I hold up a piece of paper. It bleaches the screen, a stark rectangle in the dark of my room. The hood of my sweatshirt is up; the light from my monitor glints off my round glasses and the curve of my cheekbone, leaving the rest of my face in deep shadow.)

I grew up rich. With the kind of parents who chased status like a drug. They decided I was supposed to be a prodigy—a microbiology prodigy. One of those fancy-pants people who stops pandemics. It didn't matter that I struggled. It didn't matter what I wanted.

They had a… different approach to education. Our home labs were better equipped than most universities. I was their first and most devoted student. And when theory wasn't enough, when they needed to see how the work interacted with a complex mammalian system…

(A long pause. I look down, a sweep of dark hair falling past my glasses, then back into the lens, my expression flat.)

I was the most convenient subject in the house.

They called it progressive, immersive science. They had charts of my development, my reflexes, my cellular response. Their magnum opus was never going to be a published paper.

(I take a slow, steadying breath, my eyes—a sharp, unnatural red even in the low light—locked on the camera. My hands, which have been resting on the desk, come up. They grasp the sides of the hood of my brown jacket.)

It was a daughter.

(In one fluid motion, I pull the hood back. My long black hair spills out. And there, rising from the crown of my head, alert and velvety-black, are a pair of pointed wolf ears. They twitch once, as if adjusting to the cool air of the room.)

Engineered by their serum.

Chimera 9.

(A slight, wry smile touches my lips, devoid of any warmth.)

I believe this covers the 'unique biological modifications' bullet point from your email.

(The video ends. The final frame holds for a moment: my red eyes staring out from the screen, the dark fur of my wolf ears stark against my black hair. The image blinks out, replaced by two words on a black background: UPLOAD COMPLETE.)

I sit back in my chair. The room is silent except for the faint hum of my computer. The glow of the monitor is the only light, painting the edges of my hood, my desk, the empty mug. Five minutes pass. I don’t move.

Then, a soft, digital chime. A new notification slides into the corner of my screen.

(I click it. The darkness of my room is replaced by the bright white of a new email. The text is crisp, impersonal. I read it, my eyes tracing each clinical line.)

FROM: Miranda Vasquez, MD <m.vasquez@titanreach.com>
SUBJECT: RE: Video Application - Verification Required
SENT: Tonight, 21:17

Applicant Osyra,

Your submission has been received and reviewed.

The nature of the presented physiological claims necessitates a preliminary verification to rule out digital or practical artifice before formal consideration can proceed.

You are required to attend a brief, live video conference at 09:00 tomorrow (your local time). You must present yourself exactly as you appeared in your submitted recording—same environment, same attire. You will be asked to perform simple visual confirmations at my direction.

Confirmation of your attendance is required within the hour.

If verification is satisfactory, you will be scheduled for a comprehensive clinical evaluation at our facility. This on-site evaluation serves as the final stage of the interview process.

This is a procedural necessity.

Miranda Vasquez, MD
Medical Screening Director
Titan Reach Consulting

(Below her signature is a block of text: a secured Zoom link and an alphanumeric passcode. The characters look sharp, final. A set of digital keys to a door I just asked someone to open.)

I stare at the words procedural necessity. My tail, curled around the leg of my chair, gives a single, slow twitch. The email offers no greeting, no reaction to what I showed them. Just the next step. The next test.

My fingers hover over the keyboard. The cursor blinks in the reply field. Outside my window, the city lights glow, indifferent.

I hit reply. I type a single word.

Confirmed.

I send it.

(The screen dims to black again, leaving only the faint, green pulse of the power light on my computer, like a slow, steady heartbeat in the dark.)

(I don’t sleep much. The kind of tired that sits behind your eyes and hums in my bones. My ears keep tuning into the wrong things—the drip of a tap three apartments away, the scuttle of something in the walls, the low-frequency thrum of the city that never stops. When I do drift off, it’s not into dreams, but into a replay of sensations: the cold press of a stethoscope, the bite of a needle, my father’s voice noting observations in a flat, delighted tone. I wake up before my alarm, the grey dawn light seeping around the edges of my blinds. My hood is still up.)

At 08:55, I’m back in my chair. The dark room. The computer’s glow. I’ve cleared my desk, leaving only the monitor and the camera. I click the link.

The Zoom window opens. It’s just me in a small square, and a larger, empty black square labeled ‘Dr. Vasquez – Titan Reach.’ No picture. No voice. For a full minute, there’s nothing. Then her square lights up.

She’s not what I expected. Younger. Sharp features, dark hair pulled into a severe bun, glasses that reflect the light of her own screen so I can’t see her eyes. She’s in a white lab coat over a black turtleneck. Her background is a blur of sleek, grey office.

“Osyra,” she says. Her voice is the same as her email. Cool. Precise. A diagnostic tool. “Confirm your environment is identical to that of your submission.”

I pan my camera slowly, showing the dark walls, the empty desk. “It is.”

“Good. Posture, please. Sit up straight. Remove your hood.”

My hand hesitates for a fraction of a second at the edge of the fabric. Then I pull it back. My hair falls loose. My ears, freed, pivot forward, tensing towards the speaker of my laptop. I see her gaze lock onto them on her screen. She doesn’t comment.

“Shoulders,” she commands. “I need to observe the integration at the trapezius and cervical spine. Rotate them. Forward, then back in a full, slow circle.”

It feels absurd. Like a warm-up for a workout video. But I do it. I roll my shoulders forward, feeling the muscle move under my skin, then back in a wide circle. My tail, out of frame, flicks once in irritation.

“Again. Slower.”

I comply. The silence on her end is total, except for the faint tap of a keyboard.

“Now, touch your right ear. The outer cartilage. Pinch it gently and pull it forward. Hold it.”

A hot flash of humiliation burns in my chest. This is worse than the jumping. This is a direct, deliberate manipulation of the part of me that is most not human. My hand feels clumsy as I reach up. The fur is soft, the cartilage springy under my fingers. I pull it forward. It feels grotesque, like showing a wound.

“Hold for five seconds. Release. Now the left.”

I do it. My ears flatten back against my skull of their own accord the moment I let go.

“Eyes,” she says. “Look directly into the camera. Without moving your head, track my finger.”

A slender finger enters the frame of her video, moving slowly left, then right, then up, then in a diagonal. My eyes follow. The red of my irises must be blazing in the dark-room feed.

“Pupillary response appears normal. Non-standard pigmentation confirmed,” she murmurs, more to herself than to me. “Final check. Bare your teeth for the camera. Canines specifically.”

I pull my lips back. A snarl I don’t feel. The points of my teeth catch the light.

A pause. More typing.

“Satisfactory,” Dr. Vasquez says finally. The word isn’t praise. It’s a stamp. “The preliminary verification is complete. We are authorizing the in-person clinical.”

She leans slightly closer to her camera. “Report to the Titan Reach biomedical facility on 12th Avenue. Can you be there for a full-body physical evaluation at 14:00 today?”

Two o’clock. Today. No time to think. No time to back out.

“It’s a comprehensive panel. Blood work, advanced imaging, stress-testing of the modified physiognomy. Consider it a freshening up of your baseline data before field consideration.”

Field consideration. The words hang there. My ticket out. My leash.

“Is 14:00 acceptable?” she repeats, a hint of steel in the calm.

My throat is dry. I manage a single, stiff nod.

“Verbal confirmation, please.”

“Yes,” I say, the word scraping out. “Two is fine.”

“Good. An appointment confirmation and pass for the front desk will be sent to this email. Do not be late.”

Her video square goes black. The meeting ends.

I’m left staring at my own reflection in the dark monitor. My ears are still pinned back. My shoulders ache from the pointless rotations. The humiliating, precise commands still echo in the quiet room.

They just wanted to see if the puppet’s strings were attached. Now, they want to see how much weight it can hold.

The clock on my screen reads 09:07. I have less than five hours until I report to my next examination.

The Clinic

(The sterile, antiseptic chill of the Titan Reach clinic is a different kind of cold. A bright, exposed freeze, humming under fluorescent lights that reflect off every polished steel surface. I sit on the edge of the exam table, the crinkling paper sheet loud in the silent room. This stupid grey gown. My jacket and shirt are in a locker. I’m unable to put my hood up to hide. Completely exposed.)

A nurse already took vials of blood that looked too dark. Now, Dr. Vasquez enters, her eyes scanning me like a specimen slide. Some younger doctor, Chen, trails her, trying and failing to hide his gawking.

"Ms. Osyra," Vasquez says, voice like a chilled scalpel. "We'll begin with a musculoskeletal assessment. Please stand."

I stand. Here we go.

An hour. A silent, grueling hour of this.

"Full spinal extension. Hold." I arch back. I can feel them noting the curve of my spine, the way my tail shifts under the gown to counterbalance. Just like Dad’s logs. Page 42: 'Subject demonstrates exceptional lumbar pliability...'

"Remarkable," Chen whispers.

I want to tell him his fly is open. I don’t.

"Plantar flexion. To the maximum." I rise onto the balls of my feet. My calves cord, tight and defined. Vasquez gives a single, curt nod. Approval. It makes my skin crawl.

"Jump. From a standing start. As high as you can."

I bend my knees and push off. The ceiling tiles rush at my face. I land soft, knees bending perfectly. No sound. Just another data point.

"Ground reaction force must be exceptional," Chen breathes.

"Quiet, Doctor," Vasquez snaps, but she’s staring at my legs.

"Now, rapid directional changes. Follow the laser."

For ten minutes, I’m a puppet. Pivot, lunge, spring at the stupid red dot dancing on the floor. The paper beneath me shreds. I’m not winded, but a cold sweat slicks my back. It’s the sameness. The clinical commands. The measuring stares. Just a newer, shinier lab. "Note the agonist-antagonist synchronization, the lack of lactic burn," my father’s voice murmurs in my memory.

"Enough," Vasquez says. My muscles hum with unused energy. "Now, the appendages."

Appendages. Right. The features.

Chen approaches with a scanner. "May I?" he asks, hovering near my ears.

I give a stiff nod. Just get it over with.

He scans. "Dense cartilage structure, incredible vascularization. Fully integrated." He pulls a clicker from his pocket. "Please track the sound."

Click. Behind me. My left ear swivels back before I can stop it. Click. To the side. Both ears pin the location. It’s automatic. It’s humiliating.

"Auditory range?" Vasquez asks.

"Preliminary estimate suggests significant high-frequency extension," Chen says, and I can hear the gross excitement in his voice. "Dr. Vasquez, look at this." He shoves a tablet at her. "The dental scan. The canines. The roots are natural. Just elongated. It's in the bone records."

Great. My teeth are fascinating. Vasquez studies the image, lips thin. "Eyes," she commands.

The bright light hits me. I don’t flinch. I stare right back into it, letting the red in my irises burn.

"The red pigmentation is structural," Chen breathes, like he’s discovered fire. "It's not a trick. She likely has superior low-light vision."

No kidding. I’ve been telling you that.

"Tail mobility and strength."

I grit my teeth. This is the worst part. The most private part. Under their instruction, I have to lift a stupid weight with it, a little 5kg disc. I have to swish it through a full range of motion, demonstrate how it corrects my balance during a one-legged stance. The muscles at the base of my spine burn with a familiar, shameful ache.

"Fascinating. It's a fully functional counterbalance mechanism," Chen says to Vasquez, as if I’ve left the room. "Look at the base articulation."

"Look at the dermal differentiation here, the follicle patterning is novel!" Mom’s voice, bright and manic, right in my ear. I almost flinch.

Two hours. Prick tests on the inner ear. Saliva samples. Temperature probes. Each one is a key turning in a lock, opening the door to a room I’d sealed shut. I’m a living exhibit again. The Amazing Wolf-Girl. See her perform.

Finally, they stop. Vasquez looks from her clipboard to me. Her clinical detachment has hardened into something else. Verification. Conquest.

"The Chimera 9 expression appears valid and fully integrated," she announces. "No artifice. The physical is concluded. You have passed the final interview."

I pull my hoodie on in the empty locker room, yanking the hood up the second the fabric clears my head. The clinic's chemical smell is in my nose, on my skin. No relief. Just a hollow echo.

Passed. Hooray. I’ve graduated from my parents’ lab to a bigger, better-funded cage. The tests are over.

Somehow, that feels like the worst possible outcome.

Reproduction

(The second part of the exam was different. They moved me to a smaller room, the lights slightly dimmer. A female physician named Dr. Ellen arrived, her demeanor calm, with a quiet competence that felt less like an interrogation and more like a briefing. Vasquez and Chen had stepped out, leaving us in private.)

“This portion is standard for all applicants, Osyra,” Dr. Ellen explained, her voice low and even. “But given your unique physiology, we need to establish a complete baseline. This includes reproductive health.”

A cold trickle of dread cut through the hollow victory. This was the part I’d been trying not to think about. The part my parents’ notes had been most feverishly detailed about. Cyclical stability. Hormonal integration. Fertility metrics of Subject O.

It started routinely enough. Heart rate, blood pressure. My heart was a fast, steady drum against her stethoscope.

“Cardiac rhythm is strong,” she noted. “But it’s… pronounced. A deep, heavy beat. Almost a double-thump. We’ll note that.”

Then came the palpation of my abdomen and lower back. Her hands were professional, but the pressure made me tense. My tail, which had been still, gave an involuntary, anxious twitch.

“Just relax,” she murmured, but relaxing was impossible. She was mapping a terrain that was engineered, not born. When her hands pressed near my ovaries, a jolt went through me—not pain, but a deep, internal awareness, a resonance that felt like a plucked string. She felt it too and paused, her gaze sharpening.

“Interesting.”

The internal ultrasound was the worst. The cold gel, the intrusive probe. I stared at a water stain on the ceiling tile, dissociating from the sensation. But I couldn’t escape the screen she was watching. I caught a glimpse of grey, swirling shapes—my own insides, looking alien and too vivid.

“Uterine structure appears normal,” Dr. Ellen said, mostly to herself. “Ovarian activity is… significant. Follicular development is advanced and robust. Your hormone levels from the bloodwork are going to be fascinating.”

She removed the probe and handed me a towel. She then sat on a rolling stool, facing me, her tablet in her lap. Her expression was open, neutral.

“Osyra, I need you to describe your reproductive cycle for me. In your own words. Not from a textbook. What do you experience?”

The question was so blunt, so personal, it stole the air from my lungs. I’d never had to say it out loud. My parents just measured the outputs. They never asked how it felt.

I swallowed, my throat tight. “It’s… not a period,” I started, the distinction crucial. “There’s no blood. No shedding.” I forced the words out. “It’s a… a wave. It builds for weeks. My senses get painfully sharp. I can smell electricity, the minerals in concrete. My hearing picks up vibrations through the floor. I get a constant, low-grade fever. My skin feels hypersensitive, like a sunburn everywhere.”

Dr. Ellen nodded, typing notes. “And the peak?”

I looked away, focusing on the specks in the linoleum floor. “The peak… is the heat.” The clinical term felt too small for the reality. “The restlessness becomes unbearable. I can’t sit still. There’s a deep, physical… drawing sensation in my core. An ache that’s demanding. It’s not emotional. It’s a biological command. My thoughts get… simple. Focused on scent, on movement, on…” I trailed off, the next words stuck in my throat.

“On mating,” Dr. Ellen supplied, her voice gentle but matter-of-fact.

I gave a stiff nod, humiliation burning my cheeks. “Yes. The urge is overwhelming. It’s all I can feel. It lasts for about five days. Then it breaks, like a fever breaking. There’s a crash. A day or two of exhaustion and… emptiness. Then my senses reset, but they’re always dialed higher than they should be.”

“And this occurs how often?”

“Every three to four months. It’s irregular, but it’s getting more frequent.”

Dr. Ellen was quiet for a moment, her fingers still. “You’re describing a textbook estrous cycle. Common in canines and other mammals. A defined, fertile ‘heat’ period without the monthly endometrial shedding of a human menstrual cycle. Your human reproductive anatomy is being driven by a non-human hormonal protocol. The Chimera serum didn’t just give you ears and a tail. It rewired your hypothalamic-pituitary axis.”

She leaned forward slightly. “The drives you’re feeling—the focus, the physical imperative—they are powerful biological tools. They could sharpen your instincts in the field to an extraordinary degree. But uncontrolled, they are a profound liability. They could compromise your judgment, your safety, and an operation.”

She wasn’t judging me. She was assessing an asset. A flawed one.

“Given Titan Reach’s operational parameters,” she continued, her tone leaving no room for debate, “we will provide a regimen of hormonal regulators. Non-negotiable for field readiness. We will start you at the first sign of your next proestrus phase. The prescription and a monitoring kit will be couriered to you.”

So. Not a discussion. An order. A chemical leash for the biological one. I was to be a docile, predictable asset. The opposite of everything the heat represented.

“Understood,” I said, the word ash in my mouth.

Dr. Ellen stood. “Your body hasn’t just accepted the modifications, Osyra. It’s operating on their schedule. We’re just helping you keep time.” She gave a final, professional nod. “That concludes the exam. You can get dressed.”

I pulled on my clothes in the locker room. The hood went up, a meager shield against a truth now quantified in a medical file. They didn’t just know my strength; they knew my rhythm. They knew the countdown to when I would be most powerful and most vulnerable, and they had the key to lock it down.

A week passed. The couriered package arrived: a blister pack of pills and a clinical-grade basal thermometer. I left it on my kitchen counter, untouched. A tiny rebellion. Every itch, every heightened smell, I monitored with a dread that curdled into a perverse defiance. This is still mine.

The Heat

The heat hit two weeks after the exam. It wasn't a surprise; it was an ambush I’d chosen. The low ache in my bones sharpened into a furnace by dusk. My apartment was a torture chamber of amplified sensation—the fridge motor a jackhammer, the scent of my own anxiety sour and overwhelming. The courier’s pills gleamed mockingly from the counter. Taking them felt like letting them win. Not taking them felt like insanity.

The restlessness was a live wire. I couldn’t be contained. I fled to the only space left: the roof.

The night air was cool against my burning skin. The city sprawled below, a map of smells and distant sounds. I paced the gravel, my tail lashing, my ears swiveling at every distant siren, every shout from the streets. The need was a physical pressure, a hollow, pulling throb deep in my core. It was maddening.

That’s when I caught his scent.

It cut through the chemical haze of the city—clean soap, fresh linen, and underneath, something warm and vital. Human, but… distinct. Compelling. My head snapped up. He was at the far end of the roof, leaning against the parapet, looking out at the skyline. Just a silhouette.

My body moved before my mind could catch up. The need focused, honed in on that scent like a beacon. I was across the roof without deciding to go, the gravel crunching under my boots.

He turned as I approached. He was tall, with kind eyes that widened in surprise, then cautious curiosity as he took me in—the hood, the ears visible in the moonlight, the agitated tail. Most people ran. Or screamed. He just… watched.

His eyes moved from my pinned ears to my fever-bright gaze, and his expression shifted from curiosity to a dawning, careful comprehension. He didn’t look at my ears like they were costumes, but like they were… symptoms. “You’re… in some kind of trouble,” he stated softly. It wasn’t a question about what I was, but about the state I was in.

“You shouldn’t be up here alone,” I said, my voice a rough scrape. It wasn’t a warning. It was a confession.

“Neither should you,” he replied. His voice was calm. A deep, steady sound that vibrated in my chest. “I’m Leo. I live downstairs.”

I stopped a few feet away, close enough that his scent washed over me, spicy and real. The animal part of me screamed to press closer, to rub my cheek against his jacket, to taste the salt on his skin. I locked my knees to stay still.

“Osyra,” I managed.

He nodded, his gaze dropping to my twitching ears, then back to my eyes. He didn’t flinch from the red. He saw the fever in my gaze, the tremor that wasn’t from cold. He glanced from my pleading eyes to the city far below, and something in his face softened with decision, not fear.

“What do you need?” he asked, the question simple and devastating.

I didn’t have an answer that wasn’t primal, instinctual. Contact. Pressure. You.

Instead, I reached out, slowly, giving him every chance to pull back. My fingertips brushed the back of his hand where it rested on the concrete ledge. The spark of contact was electric, a jolt that straightened my spine. His skin was cool. My whole world narrowed to that point of connection.

He turned his hand, palm up. An invitation. Or a surrender.

I slid my fingers against his, twining them together. His grip was firm, steadying. The simple touch was a floodgate. The frantic, scattered energy in me coalesced, flowed toward that anchor point. The painful edge of the need blunted, not gone, but… channeled. Focused.

We stood there in the dark, hand in hand, not speaking. The city noise faded to a murmur. My breathing slowed to match his. My ears, which had been flicking at every sound, relaxed, rotating gently toward the rhythm of his heartbeat. My tail stilled, curling softly around my own ankle.

It wasn’t passion. Not yet. It was something more fundamental. A quieting. A recognition. The beast in my blood, frantic and howling, saw him and… settled.

He lifted our joined hands, his thumb stroking a slow, deliberate line across my knuckles. The gesture was unbearably gentle. Human.

“Is this okay?” he whispered.

I leaned my forehead against his shoulder, hiding my face in the clean linen scent of his shirt. I nodded.

For the first time since the heat began, the cage wasn’t pressing in. The door wasn’t open, but the lock felt… less heavy. He held my hand in the dark, and for a little while, I was not a subject, or an applicant, or a monster.

I was just a girl on a rooftop, holding onto something warm, waiting for the fever to break.
